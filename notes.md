# The idea
User
I have a program that tags pdfs. Works will but the pdfs need to be downloaded and that does not work so well. I have an idea Id like to discuss to speed up the downloading.  The prolem is all of the files I need require javascript. For that reason I have been using selenium but the results are not great.

Most of the files download easily in a a browser by clicking on a link or loading a link in your desktop browser. So why not create an app that puts the links on a page, and we just click on them. The app takes care of identifying what is downloaded and stores them. could likely get 20 or more links a minute

I would use Python or Flask. The current database is an EC2 postgres with old school python sql. How would you surggest I monitor the downloads. Should it be triggered by the clicks or just monitor the directory.

This difficulty here is tracking the files  to keep the downloads in sync with the db url they came from . 


mplementation Considerations
File Naming Conventions: Use specific naming conventions that include identifiable tokens or timestamps to match downloads with database entries.
Concurrency: Handle concurrency issues where multiple files might be downloaded and processed at the same time.
Database Schema: Ensure your database schema can handle storing URLs, timestamps, and statuses of downloads effectively.
Error Handling: Robustly handle errors in downloads or file processing to ensure system stability.
Example Code for Directory Monitoring with Watchdog
Here’s a simple example using watchdog:
from watchdog.observers import Observer
from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler


```pythonn
import os
import time
class DownloadHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):
    def on_created(self, event):
        if event.is_directory:
            return
        filepath = event.src_path
        filename = os.path.basename(filepath)
        print(f"New file detected: {filename}")
        # Process your file here (e.g., tagging, updating DB)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    path = '/path/to/download/directory'
    event_handler = DownloadHandler()
    observer = Observer()
    observer.schedule(event_handler, path, recursive=False)
    observer.start()
    try:
        while True:
            time.sleep(10)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        observer.stop()
    observer.join()
```


# The psql copy command
The data you've extracted looks like it was formatted for viewing in `psql` rather than being structured for easy import into another database. The output includes the row presentation as it appears in `psql`, which is useful for checking content directly in the terminal but not suitable for importing via SQL files.

To properly import this data into your local database, you'll need to export it in a format that can be executed as SQL commands or that can be ingested using tools like PostgreSQL's `COPY` command.

### Creating Import-Friendly SQL Data Files

#### 1. Export Using COPY Command
The `COPY` command in PostgreSQL is useful for exporting and importing data in a plain text format, which is more direct and efficient for database operations than the output format shown. Here’s how you can export your data into a CSV file, which can then be easily imported into another database:

1. **Export Data to CSV Using COPY**:
   Connect to your production database using `psql` and run the following commands:

   ```sql
   -- Export 'domains' table data to CSV
   \copy (SELECT * FROM domains LIMIT 5000) TO 'domains_data.csv' CSV HEADER;

   -- Export 'pdf_links' table data to CSV
   \copy (SELECT * FROM pdf_links LIMIT 5000) TO 'pdf_links_data.csv' CSV HEADER;
   ```

   This will create CSV files `domains_data.csv` and `pdf_links_data.csv` with headers, making them suitable for import operations.

#### 2. Import Data From CSV Into Local Database
Once you have your CSV files, you can import them into your local database using the `COPY` command or `\copy` if you are using `psql`:

1. **Connect to your local database** using `psql`:
   ```bash
   psql -U local_username -d local_test_db
   ```

2. **Import CSV files into the local database**:
   ```sql
   -- Import into 'domains'
   \copy domains FROM 'path_to_your_file/domains_data.csv' CSV HEADER;

   -- Import into 'pdf_links'
   \copy pdf_links FROM 'path_to_your_file/pdf_links_data.csv' CSV HEADER;
   ```

### Verify the Import
After importing the data, verify that the records are correctly imported:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM domains;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pdf_links;
```

This should reflect the expected number of records (5000 each if all went well).
