# The idea
User
I have a program that tags pdfs. Works will but the pdfs need to be downloaded and that does not work so well. I have an idea Id like to discuss to speed up the downloading.  The prolem is all of the files I need require javascript. For that reason I have been using selenium but the results are not great.

Most of the files download easily in a a browser by clicking on a link or loading a link in your desktop browser. So why not create an app that puts the links on a page, and we just click on them. The app takes care of identifying what is downloaded and stores them. could likely get 20 or more links a minute

I would use Python or Flask. The current database is an EC2 postgres with old school python sql. How would you surggest I monitor the downloads. Should it be triggered by the clicks or just monitor the directory.

This difficulty here is tracking the files  to keep the downloads in sync with the db url they came from . 


mplementation Considerations
File Naming Conventions: Use specific naming conventions that include identifiable tokens or timestamps to match downloads with database entries.
Concurrency: Handle concurrency issues where multiple files might be downloaded and processed at the same time.
Database Schema: Ensure your database schema can handle storing URLs, timestamps, and statuses of downloads effectively.
Error Handling: Robustly handle errors in downloads or file processing to ensure system stability.
Example Code for Directory Monitoring with Watchdog
Here’s a simple example using watchdog:
from watchdog.observers import Observer
from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler


```pythonn
import os
import time
class DownloadHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):
    def on_created(self, event):
        if event.is_directory:
            return
        filepath = event.src_path
        filename = os.path.basename(filepath)
        print(f"New file detected: {filename}")
        # Process your file here (e.g., tagging, updating DB)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    path = '/path/to/download/directory'
    event_handler = DownloadHandler()
    observer = Observer()
    observer.schedule(event_handler, path, recursive=False)
    observer.start()
    try:
        while True:
            time.sleep(10)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        observer.stop()
    observer.join()
```
